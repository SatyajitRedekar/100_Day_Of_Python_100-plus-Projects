# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
""" the problem is the range fuction exclude the 1 and 20"""
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
"""the for loop is going from 2 to 19"""
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
"""we need to change the range fuction from range(0,21) or get the randint(1,20)"""
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
"""the for loop is going from 2 to 19"""
