ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª

Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

1

2

3

and file2.txt contained:

2

3

4

result = [2, 3]


IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!

Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.


1. Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

2. First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.

3. This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp

4. Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the `in` keyword. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp

5. Remember you can use the int() method in python to convert a string into an integer.


solution

with open("file1.txt") as file1:
  list1 = file1.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as file2:
  list2 = file2.readlines()

result = [int(num) for num in list1 if num in list2]

print(result)
